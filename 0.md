A.N.G.E.L. Log-0: Prologue.

The trip was worth it, I finally made it. I found the Pantheon of Glass. Seen as only a myth by many, I was determined to locate it, and I did. Nobody appears to know how this enigma of a structure came to be, but I am here to research it, to investigate it, to pursue the knowledge locked within it’s mesmerizing columns of purple crystal and garden of obsidian totems. I have decided I will set up a lab beneath the Pantheon to conduct further research in, and I am calling it the Altitude Negative Glass Experimentation Lab. 

Digging beneath the Pantheon reveals that there is more than meets the eye regarding how it’s structured. There appears to be ‘roots’ connecting the Pantheon to the earth, attempting to destroy these roots prove futile. After realizing this, I briefly went to attempt to chip at the Pantheon itself with a hand drill, which also proved my theory that the Pantheon’s crystal is seemingly indestructible and immovable. This will prove a definite issue in construction of the A.N.G.E.L, but I should be able to dig and build around the roots.
