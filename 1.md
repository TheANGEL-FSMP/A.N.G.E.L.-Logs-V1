A.N.G.E.L. Log-1: Genesis Experiments.

After setting up basic necessities inside of the A.N.G.E.L. I began conducting experiments on the Pantheon immediately. My first experiment involved shining a standard lightweight laser pointer through one of the glass roots of the Pantheon. The result of this was a minor lab fire due to how much the laser got magnified by the glass. The fire scorched some of the laboratory tile but otherwise no major damage was caused. After conducting this experiment I have come to the conclusion that any light which passes through the Pantheon’s glass appears to be magnified an incredible amount.

The second experiment I conducted was firing a .50 caliber sniper rifle at the glass to see if the glass isn’t really invincible. After firing 5 rounds at the Pantheon itself I have conducted that it truly is completely unbreakable.Every bullet fired harmlessly ricocheted off of the Pantheon walls and went off into the mountain range behind me, possibly nailing an innocent creature in the head. One of the rounds fired almost hit me right in the eye, but narrowly missed. The conclusion from this test was to always wear eye protection when conducting any further experiments involving high velocity projectiles.

I will conduct more experiments at a later date, for now I realize it is a bigger priority to set up more in the A.N.G.E.L. rather than conduct experiments.
