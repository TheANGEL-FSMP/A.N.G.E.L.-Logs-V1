A.N.G.E.L. Log-2: The Egg.

Today I was loitering around inside of the Pantheon out of boredom, when I noticed something peculiar in the floor of it. There was a small, perfectly square indent into the floor of the Pantheon. I knew this had to be here for a reason, there was no way it could have been caused by someone, the glass is completely impervious. I began to ponder if it was a slot for something. It was too small for a standard meter-sized block, and larger than a creature head. Then I remembered a block with a base larger than a player head but smaller than a full block.

The Dragon Egg.

I retrieved the Dragon Egg from my ender chest and placed it in the indented glass, and it fit perfectly. As soon as I did that, I got launched away and upwards in a shockwave. I looked back towards the egg and saw the part of the floor where the egg was beginning to quickly rise up. After rising about a couple of meters it stopped suddenly, and strands of glass began to come out of the floor around it, slowly entwining the egg in the same purple crystal the Pantheon itself is made out of, until a solid cube of glass entirely surrounded the egg, with a loud thud when it finished. The only thing preventing it from being a perfect cube was a small indent, in the perfect shape and size to fit my palm. I am not sure what the purpose of it is, but I am not interested in finding out at the moment. After this bizarre event, I think I need a rest. I will return to the A.N.G.E.L. and reminisce on this event that happened today.

Attached to the log is an image of the egg and its current resting spot inside of the cube.
