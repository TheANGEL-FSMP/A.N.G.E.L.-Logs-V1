A.N.G.E.L. Log-3: The Capsule.

Hello? It seems Iâ€™m back. An unnatural transdimensional burst of energy appears to have knocked out all my communication systems for around a week. I managed to get everything back online however, and while systems were down I began research and development on a seemingly impenetrable vacuum sealed container. Costing absurd amounts funds in research and resources for actually creating the vessel, I realize that without a use for it currently it's just a massive paperweight. After the lid seals on top of the base of the vessel, it is then rooted down with iron chains to prevent any chance of escape in the event that it is needed for sealing something that may be interested in escaping.
